Module **hybridLFPy**
=====================

Python module implementating a hybrid model scheme for predictions of
extracellular potentials (local field potentials, LFPs) of spiking
neuron network simulations. 


Development
-----------

The module hybridLFPy was mainly developed in the Computational Neuroscience
Group (http://compneuro.umb.no), Department of Mathemathical Sciences and
Technology (http://www.nmbu.no/imt), at the Norwegian University of Life
Sciences (http://www.nmbu.no), Aas, Norway, in collaboration with Institute of
Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-6) and Institute for Advanced Simulation (IAS-6),

Installation
============

First download all the ``hybridLFPy`` source files using ``git``
(http://git-scm.com). Open a terminal window and type:
::
    
    cd $HOME/where/to/put/hybridLFPy
    git clone https://github.com/INM-6/hybridLFPy.git
    

To use ``hybridLFPy`` from any working folder without installing files, add this
path to ``$PYTHONPATH``. Edit your ``.bash_profile`` or similar file, and add:
::    
    
    export $PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/PATH/TO/THIS/FOLDER:
    
Installing it is also possible, but not recommended as things might change with
any pull request from the repository:
::    
    
    (sudo) python setup.py install (--user)
